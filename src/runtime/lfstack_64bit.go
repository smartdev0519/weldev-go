	// Architecture  Name              Maximum Value (exclusive)

	// but Linux imposes the above limits. amd64 has hardware
	// support for 57 bit addresses as of 2017 (56 bits for user
	// space), but Linux only uses addresses above 1<<47 for
	// mappings that explicitly pass a high hint address.

	// On AMD64, virtual addresses are 48-bit (or 57-bit) numbers sign extended to 64.
	// We shift the address left 16 to eliminate the sign extended part and make
	// room in the bottom for the count.
	//
	// On s390x, there's not much we can do, so we just hope that
	// the kernel doesn't get to really high addresses.
