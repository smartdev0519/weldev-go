// TODO(rfindley) Eventually, once we disallow type lists, we need to
//                adjust this code: for 1.17 we don't accept type parameters,
//                and for 1.18 this code is valid.
//                Leaving for now so we can see that existing errors
//                are being reported.

package go1_17 // don't permit non-interface elements in interfaces

type T[P any] interface{
	P // ERROR P is a type parameter, not an interface
}
