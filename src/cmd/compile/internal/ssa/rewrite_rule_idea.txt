idea: pack info about value substructure into an int64
all values should be encoded as 1<<x, probably byte by byte
and the hardcoded values should be encoded the same way,
or as 11111111 for "any"
then AND together "have" and "want"
and if zero in any byte (or maybe use popcount < 8?)
then skip because there is a mismatch

possibble things to include:
* number of args of v.Args[0], v.Args[1], ...
* op of v.Args[0]%8, v.Args[1]%8, ...

then can also calculate v.Args[0][0], etc at top and share,

also: cut down commutativity
