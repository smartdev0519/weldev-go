<h2 id="creating_a_new_language">
Why are you creating a new language?</h2>
<p>
TODO
</p>

<h2 id="history">
What is the history of the project?</h2>
<p>
TODO
</p>

<h2 id="ancestors">
What are Go's ancestors?</h2>
<p>
Go is in the C family, but also borrows some ideas from CSP-inspired
languages such as Newsqueak and Limbo.  The interface idea may be
related to other languages but was designed in isolation; ditto
packages.  In every respect the language was designed by thinking
about what programmers do and how to make programming, at least the
kind of programming we do, more effective, which means more fun.
</p>

<h2 id="protagonists">
Who are the protagonists?</h2>
<p>
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson laid out the goals and
original specification of the language.  Ian Taylor read the draft
specification and decided to write <code>gccgo</code>.  Russ
Cox joined later and helped move the language and libraries from
prototype to reality.
</p>

<h2 id="different_syntax">
Why is the syntax so different from C?</h2>
<p>
Other than declaration syntax, the differences are not major and stem
from two desires.  First, the syntax should feel light, without too
many mandatory keywords, repetition, or arcana.  Second, the language
has been designed to be easy to parse.  The grammar is conflict-free
and can be parsed without a symbol table.  This makes it much easier
to build tools such as debuggers, dependency analyzers, automated
documentation extractors, IDE plug-ins, and so on.  C and its
descendants are notoriously difficult in this regard but it's not hard
to fix things up.
</p>

<h2 id="declarations_backwards">
Why are declarations backwards?</h2>
<p>
They're only backwards if you're used to C. In C, the notion is that a
variable is declared like an expression denoting its type, which is a
nice idea, but the type and expression grammars don't mix very well and
the results can be confusing; consider function pointers.  Go mostly
separates expression and type syntax and that simplifies things (using
prefix <code>*</code> for pointers is an exception that proves the rule).  In C,
the declaration
</p>
<pre>
	int* a, b;
</pre>
<p>
declares a to be a pointer but not b; in Go
</p>
<pre>
	var a, b *int;
</pre>
<p>
declares both to be pointers.  This is clearer and more regular.
Also, the <code>:=</code> short declaration form argues that a full variable
declaration should present the same order as <code>:=</code> so
</p>
<pre>
	var a uint64 = 1;
</pre>
has the same effect as
<pre>
	a := uint64(1);
</pre>
<p>
Parsing is also simplified by having a distinct grammar for types that
is not just the expression grammar; keywords such as <code>func</code>
and <code>chan</code> keep things clear.
</p>

<h2 id="no_pointer_arithmetic">
Why is there no pointer arithmetic?</h2>
<p>
Safety.  Without pointer arithmetic it's possible to create a
language that can never derive an illegal address that succeeds
incorrectly.  Compiler and hardware technology has advanced to the
point where a loop using array indices can be as efficient as a loop
using pointer arithmetic.  Also, the lack of pointer arithmetic can
simplify the implementation of the garbage collector.
</p>

<h2 id="inc_dec">
Why are <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> statements and not expressions?  And why postfix, not prefix?</h2>
<p>
Without pointer arithmetic, the convenience value of pre- and postfix
increment operators drops.  By removing them from the expression
hierarchy altogether, expression syntax is simplified and the messy
issues around order of evaluation of <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
(consider <code>f(i++)</code> and <code>p[i] = q[i++]</code>)
are eliminated as well.  The simplification is
significant.  As for postfix vs. prefix, either would work fine but
the postfix version is more traditional; insistence on prefix arose
with the STL, part of a language whose name contains, ironically, a
postfix increment.
</p>


<h2 id="TODO">
TODO</h2>
<p>TODO:</p>

<pre>
Why does Go not have:
- assertions
- exceptions
- generic types

What do you have planned?
- variant types?

explain:
package designa
slices
oo separate from storage (abstraction vs. implementation)
goroutines
why garbage collection?



no data in interfaces

concurrency questions:
	why aren't maps atomic
	why csp

inheritance?
embedding?
dependency declarations in the language

oo questions
	dynamic dispatch
	clean separation of interface and implementation

why no automatic numeric conversions?

make vs new
</pre>
