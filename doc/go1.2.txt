This file collects notes about what has changed since Go 1.1
and should be mentioned in the Go 1.2 release notes.
During the Go 1.2 release process it will be necessary to convert
it to HTML, similar to go1.1.html, but for now it is a text file,
to make the process of keeping it up-to-date more lightweight.

Please keep the descriptions to a single line, starting with the
package or cmd/xxx directory name, and ending in a CL number.
Please keep the list sorted (as in sort.Strings of the lines).
