<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This is a reference manual for the Go programming language. For more information and other documents, see <a href="/">the Go home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected, and has explicit support for concurrent programming.  Programs are constructed from <i>packages</i>, whose properties allow efficient management of dependencies. The existing implementations use a traditional compile/link model to generate executable binaries.
</p>

<p>
The grammar is simple and regular, allowing for easy analysis by automatic tools such as integrated development environments.
</p>

<h2>Lexical properties</h2>

<p>
A program is constructed from a set of <i>packages</i>.  Each package is defined by one or more source files compiled separately.  In processing the source text in each file, the input is divided into a sequence of <i>tokens</i>.
</p>

<h3>Unicode text</h3>

<p>
Go source text is a sequence of Unicode code points encoded in UTF-8.  The language processor does not canonicalize the input, so it will treat a single accented code point as distinct from the same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter; those are treated as two code points.  For simplicity, this document will use the term <i>character</i> to refer to a Unicode code point.
</p>
<p>
Each code point is distinct; for example, upper and lower case letters are different characters.
</p>

<h3>Tokens</h3>

<p>
There are four classes of tokens: identifiers, keywords, operators and delimiters, and literals.  <i>White space</i>, formed from blanks, tabs, and newlines, is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token.  Comments, defined below, behave as white space.  While breaking the input into tokens, the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a valid token.
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>
There are two forms of comments.  The first starts at a the character sequence <tt>//</tt> and continues through the next newline.  The second starts at the character sequence <tt>/*</tt> and continues through the character sequence <tt>*/</tt>.  Comments do not nest.
</p>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>
An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The meaning of <i>letter</i> and <i>digit</i> is defined by the Unicode properties for the corresponding characters, with the addition that the underscore character <tt>_</tt> (U+005F) is considered a letter.  The first character in an identifier must be a letter. <font color=red>(Current implementation accepts only ASCII digits for digits.)</font>
</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>
The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers.
</p>
<pre>
break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct
chan         else         goto         package      switch
const        fallthrough  if           range        type
continue     for          import       return       var
</pre>

<h3>Operators and Delimiters</h3>

<p>
The following character sequences are tokens representing operators, delimiters, and other special lexemes:
</p>
<pre>
+    &amp;     +=    &amp;=     &amp;&amp;    ==    !=    (    )
-    |     -=    |=     ||    &lt;     &lt;=    [    ]
*    ^     *=    ^=     &lt;-    &gt;     &gt;=    {    }
/    <<    /=    <<=    ++    =     :=    ,    ;
%    >>    %=    >>=    --    !     ...   .    :
</pre>
