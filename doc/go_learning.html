<h3 id="oscon_go"><a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/15464">Go Emerging Languages Conference Talk</a></h3>
<p>
Rob Pike's Emerging Languages Conference presentation delivered in July 2010. See the <a href="http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/45/Go%20Presentation.pdf">presentation slides</a>. Abstract:
</p>
<p><i>
Go’s approach to concurrency differs from that of many languages, even those
(such as Erlang) that make concurrency central, yet it has deep roots. The path
from Hoare’s 1978 paper to Go provides insight into how and why Go works as it
does.
