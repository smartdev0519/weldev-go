<h2 id="TODO">TODO(go-dev): Write this document</h2>

<p>
Have to work on the tools first.

<p>
Text previously from the FAQ placed here for safekeeping.

<ol>
<li>If it's a significant change, discuss on the mailing list before embarking.

<li>Check out the Go source code files.  The library sources are in <code>go/src/pkg</code>.

<li>Make changes; add tests as appropriate. Try to follow existing style,
    including tabs for indentation, and no trailing whitespace. In
    documentation comments for public declarations, use full sentences
    and begin with the name of the thing being described, because godoc
    (or other tools) may someday display these comments out of context.

<li>Write the <code>Makefile</code> by following existing examples.

<li>Run <code>make</code> and <code>make test</code> in the affected
    directories.

<li>If you have added a new dependency, you may need to <code>cd go/src/lib;
    ./deps.bash</code> to update the Make.deps file included in the Makefile.
    For a new component, update the <code>Makefile</code> and then run
    <code>deps.bash</code>.
<li><code>cd go/src; ./all.bash</code>

<li>Once <code>all.bash</code> succeeds (output like
    "N known bugs; 0 unexpected bugs" is OK),
    <a href="/doc/contribute.html">submit a CL</a>.
</ol>
