<h3 id="int">Size of int on 64-bit platforms</h3>

<p>
The language allows the implementation to choose whether the <code>int</code> type and <code>uint</code> types are 32 or 64 bits. Previous Go implementations made <code>int</code> and <code>uint</code> 32 bits on all systems. Both the gc and gccgo implementations (TODO: check that gccgo does) <a href="http://golang.org/issue/2188">now make <code>int</code> and <code>uint</code> 64 bits on 64-bit platforms such as AMD64/x86-64</a>.
Among other things, this enables the allocation of slices with
more than 2 billion elements on 64-bit platforms.
</p>

<p>
<em>Updating</em>:
Most programs will be unaffected by this change.
Because Go does not allow implicit conversions between distinct
<a href="/ref/spec#Numeric_types">numeric types</a>,
no programs will stop compiling due to this change.
However, programs that contain implicit assumptions
that <code>int</code> is only 32 bits may change behavior.
For example, this code prints a positive number on 64-bit systems and
a negative one on 32-bit systems:

<pre>
x := ^uint32(0) // x is 0xffffffff
i := int(x)     // i is -1 on 32-bit systems, 0xffffffff on 64-bit
fmt.Println(i)
</pre>

<p>Portable code intending 32-bit sign extension (yielding -1 on all systems)
would instead say:
</p>

<pre>
i := int(int32(x))
</pre>

<h3 id="asm">Assembler</h3>

<p>
Due to the <a href="#int">int</a> and TODO: OTHER changes,
the placement of function arguments on the stack has changed.
Functions written in assembly will need to be revised at least
to adjust frame pointer offsets.
