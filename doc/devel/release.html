This release includes a package change. In container/vector, the Iter method
has been removed from the Vector, IntVector, and StringVector types. Also, the

<h3 id="2010-07-01">2010-07-01</h3>

<pre>
This release includes some package changes that may require changes to 
client code.

The Split function in the bytes and strings packages has been changed.
The count argument, which limits the size of the return, previously treated
zero as unbounded. It now treats 0 as 0, and will return an empty slice.  
To request unbounded results, use -1 (or some other negative value).
The new Replace functions in bytes and strings share this behavior.
This may require you change your existing code.

The gob package now allows the transmission of non-struct values at the
top-level. As a result, the rpc and netchan packages have fewer restrictions
on the types they can handle.  For example, netchan can now share a chan int.

The release also includes a Code Walk: "Share Memory By Communicating".
It describes an idiomatic Go program that uses goroutines and channels:
	http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/

There is now a Projects page on the Go Dashboard that lists Go programs, 
tools, and libraries:
	http://godashboard.appspot.com/project

Other changes:
* 6a, 6l: bug fixes.
* bytes, strings: add Replace.
* cgo: use slash-free relative paths for .so references.
* cmath: correct IsNaN for argument cmplx(Inf, NaN) (thanks Charles L. Dorian).
* codereview: allow multiple email addresses in CONTRIBUTORS.
* doc/codewalk: add Share Memory By Communicating.
* exp/draw/x11: implement the mapping from keycodes to keysyms.
* fmt: Printf: fix bug in handling of %#v, allow other verbs for slices
        Scan: fix handling of EOFs.
* gc: bug fixes and optimizations.
* gob: add DecodeValue and EncodeValue,
        add support for complex numbers.
* goinstall: support for Bazaar+Launchpad (thanks Gustavo Niemeyer).
* io/ioutil: add TempFile for Windows (thanks Peter Mundy).
* ld: add -u flag to check safe bits; discard old -u, -x flags.
* math: amd64 versions of Exp and Fabs (thanks Charles L. Dorian).
* misc/vim: always override filetype detection for .go files.
* net: add support for DNS SRV requests (thanks Kirklin McDonald),
        initial attempt to implement Windows version (thanks Alex Brainman).

        eliminate the need for a pointer value in Import and Export.
* os/signal: only catch all signals if os/signal package imported.

<h3 id="2010-06-21">2010-06-21</h3>

<pre>
This release includes a language change. The "..." function parameter form is
gone; "...T" remains. Typically, "...interface{}" can be used instead of "...".

The implementation of Printf has changed in a way that subtly affects its
handling of the fmt.Stringer interface. You may need to make changes to your
code. For details, see:
        https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/6fffba90a3e3dc06

The reflect package has been changed. If you have code that uses reflect, 
it will need to be updated. For details, see:
        https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/msg/7a93d07c590e7beb

This release contains many fixes and improvements, including several
clarifications and consolidations to the Language Specification.

The type checking rules around assignments and conversions are simpler but more
restrictive: assignments no longer convert implicitly from *[10]int to []int
(write x[0:] instead of &x), and conversions can no longer change the names of
types inside composite types.

format-driven (fmt.Scanf) scanners for all basic types.

<h3 id="2010-03-30">2010-03-30</h3>

<pre>
This release contains three language changes:

1. Accessing a non-existent key in a map is no longer a run-time error.  
It now evaluates to the zero value for that type.  For example:
        x := myMap[i]   is now equivalent to:   x, _ := myMap[i]

2. It is now legal to take the address of a function's return value.  
The return values are copied back to the caller only after deferred
functions have run.

3. The functions panic and recover, intended for reporting and recovering from
failure, have been added to the spec:
	http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Handling_panics 
In a related change, panicln is gone, and panic is now a single-argument
function.  Panic and recover are recognized by the gc compilers but the new
behavior is not yet implemented.

The ARM build is broken in this release; ARM users should stay at release.2010-03-22.

Other changes:
* bytes, strings: add IndexAny.
* cc/ld: Add support for #pragma dynexport,
        Rename dynld to dynimport throughout. Cgo users will need to rerun cgo.

        use http GET for remote search instead of rpc.
* gofmt: don't convert multi-line functions into one-liners,
        preserve newlines in multiline selector expressions (thanks Risto Jaakko Saarelma).
* goinstall: include command name in error reporting (thanks Andrey Mirtchovski)
* http: add HandleFunc as shortcut to Handle(path, HandlerFunc(func))

There is one language change: the ability to convert a string to []byte or 
[]int.  This deprecates the strings.Bytes and strings.Runes functions.
You can convert your existing sources using these gofmt commands:
	gofmt -r 'strings.Bytes(x) -> []byte(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
	gofmt -r 'strings.Runes(x) -> []int(x)' -w file-or-directory-list
After running these you might need to delete unused imports of the "strings" 
package.

Other changes and fixes:
* 6l/8l/5l: add -r option
* 8g: make a[byte(x)] truncate x
* codereview.py: fix for compatibility with hg >=1.4.3
* crypto/blowfish: new package (thanks Raif S. Naffah)
* dashboard: more performance tuning
* fmt: use String method in %q to get the value to quote.
* gofmt: several cosmetic changes
* http: fix handling of Connection: close, bug in http.Post
* net: correct DNS configuration,
	fix network timeout boundary condition,
	put [ ] around IPv6 addresses for Dial.
* path: add Match,
	fix bug in Match with non-greedy stars (thanks Kevin Ballard)
* strings: delete Bytes, Runes (see above)
* tests: an Eratosthenesque concurrent prime sieve (thanks Anh Hai Trinh)

There are two small language changes: the meaning of chan <- chan int
is now defined, and functions returning functions do not need to 
parenthesize the result type.

There is one significant implementation change: the compilers can
handle multiple packages using the same name in a single binary.
In the gc compilers, this comes at the cost of ensuring that you
always import a particular package using a consistent import path.
In the gccgo compiler, the cost is that you must use the -fgo-prefix
flag to pass a unique prefix (like the eventual import path).

Since the last release there has been one large syntactic change to
the language, already discussed extensively on this list: semicolons
are now implied between statement-ending tokens and newline characters.
See http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/t/5ee32b588d10f2e9 for
details.

By default, gofmt now parses and prints the new lighter weight syntax.
To convert programs written in the old syntax, you can use:

	gofmt -oldparser -w *.go

Since everything was being reformatted anyway, we took the opportunity to
change the way gofmt does alignment.  Now gofmt uses tabs at the start
of a line for basic code alignment, but it uses spaces for alignment of
interior columns.  Thus, in an editor with a fixed-width font, you can
choose your own tab size to change the indentation, and no matter what
tab size you choose, columns will be aligned properly.


In addition to the syntax and formatting changes, there have been many
smaller fixes and updates:

6g,8g,5g: many bug fixes, better registerization,
   build process fix involving mkbuiltin (thanks Yongjian Xu),
   method expressions for concrete types
8l: support for Windows PE files (thanks Hector Chu)
